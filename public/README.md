# lets understand KCL


Imagine that you have a big bucket of water, and you have a bunch of pipes connected to it. The water in the bucket represents the current, and the pipes represent the wires that carry the current.

Kirchhoff's Current Law says that the total amount of water (current) going into the bucket has to be the same as the total amount of water coming out of the bucket. Just like how you can't magically create water or make it disappear, you can't create or destroy current in an electrical circuit.

> IT"S INTERACTIVE! play with the pipe and see how the water flows

So, if you have three pipes bringing water into the bucket,(imagine the arrows to be the water) you need to have three pipes taking water out of the bucket to keep everything in balance. And in the same way, if you have three wires bringing current into a circuit, you need to have three wires taking current out of the circuit to make sure that the total amount of current stays the same.

(note: we tried simulating water first to go with our analogy but that proved extremely difficult)
